## 2.0.3

### Patch Changes

- Comprehensive Russian & English Ecosystem Localization Phase 2

    - **Ecosystem-wide Localization Wrappers:** Swept `admin`, `account`, `docs`, `cdn`, and `www` applications, systematically replacing hardcoded English strings with `@xernerx/providers` `useDictionary` hooks.
    - **Deep Dictionary Integrations:** Centralized hundreds of new configuration keys into `@xernerx/lib` (`ru.json` and `en-GB.json`), including complex nested objects for the Admin dashboard matrix, application package documentation, Account Media Library, and dynamic notification settings (`api`, `billing`, `apps`, `virtue`).
    - **Server/Client Boundary Separation:** Resolved React boundary crashes by explicitly splitting async data-fetching Server Components (like `PackageDetails`) away from new `'use client'` components strictly dedicated to translation contexts.
    - **Turbopack Cache Busting:** Mitigated Next.js 16 caching glitches by introducing manual invalidation markers (`// Force recompile`) when heavily rewriting ASTs with new context hooks.
    - **Interpolation Identifier Fixes:** Audited and resolved deep dictionary mapping bugs where the localization parser crashed because interpolation variables (e.g. `{current}`, `{error}`) were incorrectly translated into literal Cyrillic identifiers in the JSON tree.
    - **Widget Translation Parity:** Restored and translated hidden edge-cases in `@xernerx/components`, including the `SidebarUser` daily gift claiming states and success/error notification toasts.
    - **Cross-App Deep Linking:** Upgraded inter-app navigation URLs (like `Switch to Admin` and `Go to Translations` from the Account app) to support `?view=` query parameters, landing users securely into explicit Admin views (`?view=media`, `?view=translations`).
