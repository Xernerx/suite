## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

-   - Added debounced infinite scroll to Users table to prevent rapid continuous fetching
    - Fixed alphabetical sorting to always push users with empty names to the bottom of the list
    - Fixed z-index stacking context so Confirm dialogs appear over standard edit Modals
    - Fixed `useToast` import missing from Roles and Tokens causing Turbopack build failures
    - Fixed hydration environment mismatch that caused immediate CORS failures when fetching in dev

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

-   - Restyled the `api` app landing page to feature the premium glassmorphism aesthetic.
    - Fixed hydration mismatch issues involving `next/link` and translated dictionaries.
    - Resolved Discord API `Failed to fetch` error that broke the User account synchronization by splitting try/catch blocks and gracefully bypassing Discord CORS failures.
    - Ensured session cookies traverse successfully between client subdomains and the API route by adding `credentials: 'include'` to `UserProvider` fetches.
    - Fixed a bug where same-origin browser API calls lacked `Origin` headers, preventing them from bypassing the `proxy.ts` middleware authentication block.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- ### Dashboard (apps/app)
    - Restyled the dashboard configuration interface into a responsive, full-width SPA layout without arbitrary height restrictions, allowing native body scrolling.
    - Implemented premium glassmorphism aesthetics (`bg-(--foreground)/30`, `backdrop-blur-md`, `rounded-[2rem]`) and grid-based cards (Server Sync Data, Server Info, Privacy & Data).
    - Rendered Discord guild banners natively within the layout.
    - Replaced native HTML `<select>` elements with the custom `@xernerx/ui` `<Selector>` component (`items={true}`).
    - Fixed build errors regarding the `<Loading />` component variant and Recharts tooltip label formatting.

    ### API & Middleware (apps/api)
    - Updated `core/users/[id]/discord/guilds` to successfully map and return `bannerUrl` for Discord guilds.
    - Created `secure/guilds/[id]` endpoint for profile persistence.
    - Resolved token invalidation loop (`proxy.ts`) by removing unnecessary `Authorization` headers on internal DB requests, instead relying on Next-Auth session cookies.
    - Resolved TypeScript errors in bot voting endpoints (`secure/bots/[id]/vote`).

    ### Desktop App (apps/desktop)
    - Configured dynamic routing in `main.ts` so canary builds automatically point `WEB_URL` to `https://app.canary.xernerx.com` by sniffing the version string for `canary`.

    ### Packages & Providers
    - **@xernerx/ui**: Expanded `InputProps` to include the `rows` property to support `variant="textarea"`, fixing upstream compilation errors in `apps/auth`.
    - **@xernerx/providers**: Wrapped `getEnvUrl` in a `useCallback` hook inside `EnvironmentProvider` to prevent infinite re-render fetch loops against the Discord API.
    - **@xernerx/lib**: Exported `GuildSchema` to the central registry.
