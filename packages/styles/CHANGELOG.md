### Patch Changes

- ### Platform Features & Enhancements
    - **App (Portal)**: Overhauled the Organization profile configuration page with a modern interactive UI. Replaced standard file upload buttons with an interactive, Discord-style avatar and banner overlay with hover edit states.
    - **App (Portal)**: Added deferred-save functionality utilizing `URL.createObjectURL` to provide instant, client-side previews for avatar and banner uploads prior to submission.
    - **App (Portal)**: Upgraded the organization and bot detailed description inputs into a rich text Markdown editor featuring a Write/Preview tab toggle.
    - **App (Portal)**: Added an interactive tag management UI to the bot portal page.
    - **Lib (Database)**: Expanded the Mongoose Organization `Profile` schema by adding `iconUrl` and `bannerUrl` properties to explicitly support custom CDN image uploads alongside legacy Discord icons.
    - **Lib (Database)**: Expanded the Mongoose Bot `Profile` schema to support a new `dashboard` link field, making it available in the portal link configurations.
    - **API**: Updated the `PATCH /secure/organizations/[id]` endpoint to whitelist and securely save the new `iconUrl` and `bannerUrl` payload fields.
    - **API**: Updated the bot endpoints (`/secure/bots`) to properly parse and return the new tags and dashboard link configurations.

    ### Bug Fixes
    - **CDN**: Completely refactored the `/raw/[id]` media fetching proxy to use the official `@vercel/blob` SDK. This replaces manual HTTP requests and fixes a critical issue where private blobs failed to authenticate in production (returning `502 Bad Gateway`) by correctly utilizing Vercel's automatic OIDC token resolution.
    - **CDN**: Patched the `/upload` endpoint payload to return direct byte-stream URLs (`/raw/[id]`) instead of HTML dashboard URLs (`/view/[id]`), fixing broken image renders.
    - **CDN**: Appended the `addRandomSuffix: true` option to Vercel Blob uploads to guarantee global filename uniqueness and prevent caching collisions.
    - **App (Portal)**: Fixed an issue where the Portal was requesting production CDN images during local development by wrapping all avatar and banner URL references with the `getEnvUrl()` provider hook.
    - **Database**: Executed a global MongoDB migration across the `organizations`, `users`, `guilds`, and `bots` profiles to convert all legacy, broken `/view/` CDN URLs into the correct `/raw/` format.

## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- Comprehensive Russian & English Ecosystem Localization Phase 2

    - **Ecosystem-wide Localization Wrappers:** Swept `admin`, `account`, `docs`, `cdn`, and `www` applications, systematically replacing hardcoded English strings with `@xernerx/providers` `useDictionary` hooks.
    - **Deep Dictionary Integrations:** Centralized hundreds of new configuration keys into `@xernerx/lib` (`ru.json` and `en-GB.json`), including complex nested objects for the Admin dashboard matrix, application package documentation, Account Media Library, and dynamic notification settings (`api`, `billing`, `apps`, `virtue`).
    - **Server/Client Boundary Separation:** Resolved React boundary crashes by explicitly splitting async data-fetching Server Components (like `PackageDetails`) away from new `'use client'` components strictly dedicated to translation contexts.
    - **Turbopack Cache Busting:** Mitigated Next.js 16 caching glitches by introducing manual invalidation markers (`// Force recompile`) when heavily rewriting ASTs with new context hooks.
    - **Interpolation Identifier Fixes:** Audited and resolved deep dictionary mapping bugs where the localization parser crashed because interpolation variables (e.g. `{current}`, `{error}`) were incorrectly translated into literal Cyrillic identifiers in the JSON tree.
    - **Widget Translation Parity:** Restored and translated hidden edge-cases in `@xernerx/components`, including the `SidebarUser` daily gift claiming states and success/error notification toasts.
    - **Cross-App Deep Linking:** Upgraded inter-app navigation URLs (like `Switch to Admin` and `Go to Translations` from the Account app) to support `?view=` query parameters, landing users securely into explicit Admin views (`?view=media`, `?view=translations`).
